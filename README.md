# README

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of the scripts developed for the MSc Building Technology thesis project at TU Delft. The scripts are provided as Jupyter Notebook files and can be easily converted into Python files for usage in the tool. The primary tool file is `0. Front-End.ipynb`, which serves as the entry point for running the tool.

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts and use the tool, you need to ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Python**: Install Python version 3.10 or later.
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook to execute the provided `.ipynb` files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/EdaAkaltun/Project-T
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Access the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser by following the link provided in the terminal.

3. Open the `0. Front-End.ipynb` file from the notebook interface.

4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the tool.

## Additional Information

- Each script is provided with comments and documentation to assist in understanding the code and its functionality.
- Feel free to modify the scripts.
- Climada is downloaded along when using requirements.txt, but not necessary to run the script. This portion can be skipped.
